Solutions to competitive programming problems I attempt will be in this repository.

Here is a **schedule** of problem "types" I will be attempting during my long CP journey:

1. [Sorting and Searching](https://github.com/jessechoe10/CP/tree/master/CF/Sorting%20and%20Searching) ~ 8 Weeks
2. [Graph Theory - Coming Soon] ~ 8 Weeks
3. [Dynamic Programming - Coming Soon] ~ 8 Weeks
