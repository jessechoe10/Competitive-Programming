# Segment Tress

Hi!

Segment Trees are a very useful data structure which has various applications in competitive programming problems. One of the more well-known applications of
segment trees are finding the sum of a subarray with between [l, r]. This can be computed using prefix sums, but often times, problems ask you to change a given 
element in the array which would reduce the prefix sums method to a time complexity of `O(n ^ 2)`. Using segment trees, we can reduce this to a time complexity 
of `O(n log n)` which is obviously better.
