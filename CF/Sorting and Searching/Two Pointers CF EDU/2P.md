# Two-Pointer Technique

Hi!

The two-pointer technique is a technique that uses two monotonic pointers to efficiently traverse an array. This technique
allows you to solve problems in linear time rather than quadratic time. **Without a loss of generality**, the two pointer technique is more useful in a sorted array.
